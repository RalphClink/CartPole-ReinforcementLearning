## Overview
This set of code is used to analyse the performance of a Reinforcement Learning Agent using a Rainbow/C51 Algorithm, DQN Algorithm and a random method

## Instructions
To run the different experiments and plot the results run the main file. Inside this file a controller class is created.
This controller creates instances of the Rainbow Agent, DQN Agent and Random Agent. 
Each of these agents have a run method called 'run_rainbow', 'run_dqn' and 'run_random'.
The controller also has a 'plot_results' method which will compare the results and output a graph named 'Plotted Results.jpg'
